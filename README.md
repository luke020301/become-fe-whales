1. Overview

Project Name: BECOME FE (Internal Competition: Cook Series) 
+1


Mission: Empower designers to use AI as a "weapon" to bridge the gap between design and development.


Objective: Convert Whales Market Figma designs into a fully functional React application using AI tools.
+3


Timeline: 4 full-time days.
+1

2. Technical Stack

Framework: React.


Styling: Tailwind CSS.


AI Tools: Antigravity, Cursor (with Figma MCP), or Claude Code.
+1


Version Control: Public GitHub Repository.


Environment: Local development (npm run dev).
+1

3. Project Requirements
3.1 Functional Requirements

Multi-page Navigation: Implement routing between various pages (Landing, Dashboard, Detail, etc.).
+1


Interaction Logic: Buttons, links, modals, tabs, and filters must be functional.
+1


Data Handling: Use Mock Data (JSON or hardcoded) to display content; no backend required.
+1


Pixel Accuracy: Output must match Figma layouts, spacing, typography, and colors.
+1


Responsiveness: Mobile-responsive design is expected for higher grading.
+1

3.2 AI Showcase Requirements

Documentation: Maintain a record of 3–5 high-quality AI prompts or conversations.
+1


Evidence: Provide screenshots or links to conversations showing environment setup, design interpretation, and iterative feedback.
